PHP and Java are two different programming languages, and there are significant differences between them in multiple aspects. The following is a detailed introduction for you:

1. Language types and compilation methods
PHP: It is a server-side scripting language. It belongs to the category of weakly typed and dynamically typed languages. It doesn't require code compilation and can be directly interpreted and executed, which makes the development and debugging process more convenient.

Java: It is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language and belongs to the strongly-typed languages. Any Java code needs to be correctly compiled into bytecode before execution and then run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. Application fields and scope
PHP: The most classic combination is PHP + MySQL + Apache, which is very suitable for developing small and medium-sized web applications, such as websites, weblogs (Blogs), etc. It has a complete framework, shows good stability in multi-threading and high concurrency scenarios, and is also suitable for developing some embedded systems. However, it mainly focuses on web development in the Internet field.

Java: It has a wide range of application areas, including web development, mobile application development (such as Android apps), game development, desktop application development, large-scale enterprise-level application development, etc. For example, financial data management systems, hospital information management systems, large-scale e-commerce platforms, etc.

3. System Architecture and Design
PHP: It uses a procedural development approach and also supports the object - oriented system design method. A large amount of system analysis and design work is required in the early stage. It can implement a multi - layer network architecture, separating the database layer, application logic layer, and presentation logic layer from each other, and focuses on development in the Internet field.

Java: It emphasizes object-oriented design more. It is suitable for building large and complex system architectures, can better support low-level network and database processing, and can better handle complex business logic and high-concurrency requirements in enterprise-level application development.

4. Database Access and Security
PHP: Different database access interfaces are used for different databases, so the universality of database access code is not strong. Users can directly view the PHP source code, which poses a certain security risk to some extent.

Java: It accesses databases through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and the interfaces for database access are relatively unified. What users finally get of the developed program is the compiled class files, and they cannot see the complete source code, so the security is relatively high.

5. Performance and Concurrent Processing
PHP: When handling concurrent requests, its performance may be inferior to that of Java. In loop performance tests and database tests, it usually shows relatively lower performance.

Java: It has a database thread pool. Resources can be directly obtained from the connection pool when needed. It saves more resources than PHP during concurrency and has relatively higher performance.
